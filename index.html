                        <h1>Lead Council Dies</h1>
                        <p>Attorney Carl I. Brundidge, of Brundidge & Stranger PC, assisted Reggie in prosecuting his patents. Additionally, he played a crucial role in defending against Charles Hall and was instrumental in drafting the initial '566 patent enforcement actions against Coinbase and later Circle. 
                        <br></br> 
                        Due to the substantial workload, Brundidge & Stranger PC engaged Sheridan England to assist in Reggie's defense against Charles Hall. Sadly, Carl passed away in February 2023.

                        <h1>Failure to Represent</h1>
                        <p>Attorney Sheridan England, retained by Brundidge & Stranger PC to assist in representing Reggie, failed to fulfill crucial responsibilities regarding court filing requirements and deadlines pertinent to Hall v. Middleton. This failure resulted in missed filing deadlines and procedural errors that adversely affected Reggie's position in the litigation. Consequently, the court sanctioned Reggie, leading to additional legal expenses and complications in the ongoing dispute between the parties.

                        <h1>Decision and Order</h1>
                        <p>The judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (Jennifer Schecter, J.), entered on or about February 15, 2023, declared Veritaseum, Inc. (the "Company") as the rightful owner of the subject patents. The court mandated that defendant Reggie Middleton transfer the patents to the Company and awarded $1 million in punitive damages against Middleton. Additionally, plaintiff Charles Hall was granted $450,000 in attorneys' fees and costs from the Company. This decision has been unanimously affirmed without costs.

                        <h1>Just Us System</h1>
                        <p>The legal battle persists, with an inital case review indicating up to eight appealable issues, including violations of Due Process, Civil Rights, and Constitutional Rights.  
                        <br></br>
                        At this critical juncture, securing funding is essential to comply with Judge Schecter's and the First Division's orders. Failure to pay the imposed fine could force Veritaseum to liquidate assets to satisfy the ruling. This liquidation could result in Charles Hall acquiring the Middleton family patents at a fraction of their value, contrary to New York derivative shareholder laws designed to protect the collective interests of shareholders, not the agenda of a minority litigant. 
                        <br></br>
                        Despite the allegations of having been defrauded, the Veritaseum Community has remained steadfast in their commitment and support for Middleton during these financial and legal challenges.
